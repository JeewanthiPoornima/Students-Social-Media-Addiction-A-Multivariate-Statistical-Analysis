# Students' Social Media Addiction: A Multivariate Statistical Analysis

Course Project â€“ DSC4033 / STA4053: Multivariate Methods II

This project investigates the patterns and consequences of social media addiction among university students using advanced multivariate statistical techniques. The analysis draws on a dataset of 705 students, collected via an online survey that includes demographic, behavioral, and psychological variables.

The primary objective is to uncover complex relationships between social media usage, academic performance, and mental health outcomes. To achieve this, several statistical methods are applied, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, Factor Analysis (FA) for identifying latent variables, Discriminant Analysis (DA) for classifying students based on risk factors, and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) to explore associations between sets of variables.

Data preprocessing steps such as outlier detection, standardization, and handling of missing values ensure the reliability of the findings. The results highlight that problematic social media engagement is significantly associated with poorer mental health and reduced sleep quality. Discriminant analysis further enables accurate classification of students at risk for social media addiction, providing valuable insights for targeted interventions.

All analyses are performed in R, with well-documented scripts for data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization. The project demonstrates the practical application of multivariate analysis in social science research and offers actionable insights for educators, policymakers, and mental health professionals.

Researchers and students interested in digital well-being, behavioral analytics, or applied statistics will find this repository a comprehensive resource for both methodology and interpretation. Contributions, feedback, and collaborations are welcome.
